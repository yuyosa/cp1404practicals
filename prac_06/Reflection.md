# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Reflecting on this subject, I've learned to streamline my debugging process and improve my attention to detail, 
ensuring smoother code execution and clearer outputs.But I'm a little unaccustomed
and it's a bit hard for me to code

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

My goal is to manage my time more effectively during assignments and to be patient with challenges that arise.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I can maintain a good attitude and patience to complete the tasks in the face of difficulties and challenges.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I still have some trouble remembering the format of the code. I know the general format,
but I still need to work hard to remember the specific details.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I hope to make the templates that the teacher talked about in class available to students, 
so that they can learn the templates and write code after class. Otherwise, if I forget some details, 
I will need to spend a lot of time looking for the format answer.
