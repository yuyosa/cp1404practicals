# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I think only about 60 percent,Generally, there are many parts of the first design that need to be modified.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I think it's based on experience. Sometimes, after doing it a lot, I subconsciously feel that this is the way to do it.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I am still far from learning python and need more practice

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Knowing other people's different solutions to the same problem can help me broaden my perspective

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

The difference in details, by observing the details of others, I can find that there are many things worth modifying


Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Details of the discovery:](https://github.com/KarryChuh/CP1404Practicals/pull/2#issuecomment-2235337890)

### Explanation

By observing other people's records, I can not only find other people's mistakes, but also improve my own skills. 
For example, this time, I found that I can synchronize time instead of setting constants.

### Good Code Review 2

[Naming method](https://github.com/AlbertRequilme/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-13497852061)

### Explanation

Use f-string to standardize the format and make the code easier to read. 
Also, the function names should comply with the general naming conventions.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were a teacher, I would explain the examples in detail during class and share the problem-solving records after class, 
so that if students have any questions, 
they can quickly find the solution. It is not like now that they can only look up the book or ask GPT.
### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

When there are some knowledge points in the examples that I don't understand, 
I will immediately look up the book or ask. This will help me understand my shortcomings.
