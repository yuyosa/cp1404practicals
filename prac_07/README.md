## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
1."Importance of Clear Naming Conventions"
It is easy for me to make mistakes when naming variables, functions, and classes. 
I learned that proper naming conventions for variables, functions, 
and classes can make the code more readable and maintainable.

2."Break down large tasks into smaller ones"
This makes it easier to detect errors and understand the function's functionality and settings.

3."Code format"
For different functions and areas under the same function, 
I learned that different blank lines or indents are needed to distinguish each section.
